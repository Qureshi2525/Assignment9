<h1><B>The Story in the Book</B></h1>

<h2><b>Chapter1</B></h2>
<P>Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of nature, New Scientist, and all other 
scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumed copy of on The Road. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she
spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</P>

<p>She had spent last ten years in the room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have
nothing better to do" . Although many consedered here poincering work, unravling the secrets of the Ilama DNA, to be an outstanding achievements,
Molly did think she had something better to do. </p>
