 <h2>WEB AND APP MADARIS ONLINE (SMIT)</h2>
 <p><b>What is a web application?</b>
A web application is a type of app that can be accessed through a web browser. 
When accessed in a browser on a mobile device, web apps look and behave like mobile apps — but they aren’t the same.
Let’s look at the advantages and disadvantages of a web app, then define what a mobile app is.</p>
 <h2>Advantages of a Web App</h2>
 <p>Platform-SMIT: Web apps are not built for a specific platform. 
They can be built for all platforms as long as they can run in a web browser.
Low upfront costs: Since they aren’t specific to a platform, web apps don’t require a lot of time or developers to build. That means web apps will be less expensive upfront than other types of apps.
Easy to maintain: Because web apps are platform-agnostic, they don’t need to be written in a specific coding language. Instead, they use coding languages that are common across multiple platforms — typically a combination of server-side script, like PHP, and client-side script, like HTML and Javascript. This makes them relatively easy to not only build but maintain.
No app marketplace: Since web apps don’t adhere to standard operating system protocols, they don’t require approval from an app store. That means they can be released in the format and at the time the developers choose.
Automatic updates: Since web apps aren’t downloaded from an app store, users don’t have to go to the app store to manage their updates. Users always see the most up-to-date version when they open a web app.

<h3>What is a mobile app?</H3>
<p>A mobile app is the most common type of app. Also known as a native app, a mobile app is built for specific platforms, which dictates what languages they’re written in. Native iOS apps, for example, are written in Swift and Objective-C and native Android apps are written in Java or Kotlin.

Let’s look at the advantages and disadvantages of a mobile app, then compare a web and mobile app.
